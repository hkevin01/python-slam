## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Core Components
1. **SLAM Pipeline** (`src/python_slam/basic_slam_pipeline.py`)
   - ORB feature detection and matching
   - Essential Matrix pose estimation
   - Real-time trajectory tracking
   - ROS 2 integration wrapper

2. **Modular SLAM Components**
   - `feature_extraction.py` - ORB feature detection
   - `pose_estimation.py` - Camera pose estimation
   - `mapping.py` - 3D point cloud mapping
   - `localization.py` - Particle filter localization
   - `loop_closure.py` - Visual loop closure detection
   - `flight_integration.py` - Drone flight control integration

3. **ROS 2 Nodes**
   - `slam_node.py` - Main SLAM coordinator
   - `*_node.py` - Individual service nodes for each component
   - `flight_integration_node.py` - Flight control interface

### Professional Infrastructure
- **Docker**: Multi-stage containerization (dev/prod/runtime)
- **VS Code**: Advanced configuration with Copilot integration
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated CI/CD with testing and deployment
- **Quality Tools**: Black, pylint, flake8, mypy, pre-commit hooks
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive markdown docs with API references

## 🔧 Recommended Compiler Configuration

**Selected: GCC 13.3.0 x86_64-linux-gnu** ✅

**Why this is optimal:**
