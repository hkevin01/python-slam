## ÔøΩüèóÔ∏è Architecture

This project supports two deployment architectures:

### üö¢ Multi-Container Architecture (Recommended)

A modern containerized approach that separates concerns for better scalability:

- **SLAM Backend Container**: Handles ROS2 processing, sensor fusion, and SLAM algorithms
- **Visualization Container**: Provides PyQt5 GUI connected via ZeroMQ
- **Benefits**: Better performance, easier development, scalable deployment

**Why Multi-Container Architecture:**

The multi-container design was specifically chosen to solve performance and scalability challenges:

1. **Performance Isolation**: SLAM processing runs uninterrupted by GUI rendering overhead
2. **Resource Optimization**: Backend can utilize all available CPU/memory for computation
3. **Development Efficiency**: Teams can work on backend and frontend independently
4. **Deployment Flexibility**: Backend can run on robots while GUI runs on operator stations
5. **Scalability**: Multiple visualization clients can connect to one backend
6. **Fault Tolerance**: GUI crashes don't affect SLAM processing reliability

**Communication via ZeroMQ:**
- **Low Latency**: Direct TCP sockets without message broker overhead
- **High Throughput**: Efficient binary serialization for large datasets
- **Reliability**: Automatic reconnection and heartbeat monitoring
- **Cross-Network**: Supports visualization from remote locations

```bash
# Quick start with multi-container setup
./run-multi.sh up
```

**Technical Implementation:**
- Backend publishes SLAM data on port 5555 using ZMQ PUB socket
- Visualization subscribes with ZMQ SUB socket and automatic discovery
- CycloneDX DDS handles ROS2 inter-node communication within backend
- Docker networking provides service discovery and load balancing

### üì¶ Monolithic Architecture (Legacy)

Traditional single-container deployment for simpler use cases:

```bash
# Traditional single container
docker-compose up slam
```

> **Recommendation**: Use the multi-container setup for production deployments and development. See [Multi-Container Architecture Guide](docs/MULTI_CONTAINER_ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed information.

slam = BasicSlamPipeline()

# Process video stream
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
while True:
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if not ret:
        break

    # Process frame through SLAM pipeline
    pose, map_points = slam.process_frame(frame)

    # Display results
    cv2.imshow('SLAM', frame)
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

### ROS 2 Integration

```bash
# Build ROS 2 workspace (inside container)

```python
# Feature extraction
from python_slam.feature_extraction import FeatureExtraction
fe = FeatureExtraction()
features = fe.extract_features(image)

# Pose estimation
from python_slam.pose_estimation import PoseEstimation
pe = PoseEstimation()
pose = pe.estimate_pose(prev_frame, curr_frame)

# Mapping
from python_slam.mapping import Mapping
mapper = Mapping()
mapper.update(pose, features)
point_cloud = mapper.get_point_cloud()
```

- **Scalability**: Designed to scale from development to production environments
- **Maintainability**: Clean architecture with clear separation of concerns
- **Observability**: Built-in metrics, logging, and debugging capabilities

#### **Integration-First Approach**
Rather than creating another research SLAM implementation, this project prioritizes:

- **Ecosystem Compatibility**: Works with existing ROS2 and robotics infrastructure
- **Standards Compliance**: Follows industry standards (MAVLink, DDS, etc.)
- **Interoperability**: Designed to integrate with various hardware and software platforms
- **Professional Workflows**: Supports CI/CD, testing, and deployment automation

#### **Technology Selection Criteria**
Each technology was chosen based on:

1. **Maturity**: Battle-tested in production environments
2. **Performance**: Meets real-time requirements for robotics applications
