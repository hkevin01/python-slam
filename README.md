# Python SLAM Project

## Overview
This project is a Python-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) framework designed for aerial drone competitions and robotics applications. It is modular, extensible, and optimized for real-time, GPS-denied navigation.

## Initial Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-slam.git
   cd python-slam
   ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Rationale
This setup ensures modularity, reproducibility, and ease of development for aerial drone SLAM applications. See `docs/setup_instructions.md` for more details.
