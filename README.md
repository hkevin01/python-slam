# Python SLAM Project

## Overview
This project is a modular Python-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) framework designed for aerial drone competitions and robotics applications. It enables real-time localization and mapping in GPS-denied environments, with a focus on extensibility, efficiency, and robust performance.

## Project Goals
- Real-time localization and mapping without GPS
- Lightweight and efficient for onboard drone processing
- Robust to motion blur, lighting changes, and dynamic environments
- Modular design for integration with flight controllers and competition rules

## Architecture
| Module | Purpose | Tools |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) | Fuse camera + IMU for accurate pose estimation | OpenCV, ORB-SLAM3, or custom pipeline |
| Feature Extraction & Matching | Track keypoints across frames | ORB, FAST, BRIEF |
| Pose Estimation | Estimate drone motion | Essential matrix, PnP, or deep learning-based methods |
| Mapping | Build sparse or dense 3D map | Triangulation, depth prediction, or RGB-D fusion |
| Loop Closure | Correct drift and improve global consistency | Bag-of-words, pose graph optimization |
| Flight Integration | Interface with PX4 or ArduPilot | MAVLink, ROS2 |

## Phases
1. **Initial Setup**: Project structure, environment, dependencies, and rationale
2. **Core SLAM Implementation**: Feature extraction, pose estimation, mapping, and integration
3. **Testing & Validation**: Unit tests, CI workflows, benchmarking, and refactoring
4. **Documentation & Usability**: Usage examples, API reference, user feedback
5. **Deployment & Maintenance**: Automation scripts, code quality, updates, scalability
6. **Competition-Ready Enhancements**: Active SLAM, semantic mapping, GPU acceleration, lightweight deployment

## Initial Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-slam.git
   cd python-slam
   ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage Instructions
1. Run the basic SLAM pipeline:
   ```bash
   python src/basic_slam_pipeline.py
   ```
2. Run tests:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/
   ```

## Troubleshooting
- See `docs/troubleshooting.md` for common issues and solutions.
- Ensure sample images are placed in the `data/` directory for pipeline tests.
