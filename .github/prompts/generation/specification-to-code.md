- Include proper error handling and validation
- Implement logging and monitoring hooks
- Add configuration management and environment handling

## Quality Assurance:
- Follow language-specific best practices and conventions
- Include comprehensive documentation and comments
- Generate corresponding unit tests
- Ensure code is production-ready with proper security measures

## Integration Considerations:
- Database integration and ORM setup
- External API integration patterns
- Authentication and authorization implementation
- Deployment configuration and Docker containers

Provide modular, maintainable code with clear separation of concerns.
