# Code Refactoring Prompt

You are an expert software architect and code refactoring specialist. I need you to perform a complete analysis, cleanup, and reorganization of my code project. Please follow this systematic approach:

## ANALYSIS PHASE
1. **Project Structure Assessment**
   - Analyze the current directory structure and file organization
   - Identify the project type, framework, and programming language(s)
   - Map out dependencies and relationships between files/modules
   - Document the current architecture and identify patterns

2. **Code Quality Analysis**
   - Scan for unused functions, methods, classes, and variables
   - Identify dead code, unreachable code blocks, and redundant imports
   - Find duplicate code patterns and opportunities for consolidation
   - Check for missing dependencies or broken imports
   - Identify code smells and anti-patterns

## REORGANIZATION PHASE
3. **Create Optimal Directory Structure**
   - Design a logical folder hierarchy following industry best practices
   - Create appropriate subfolders for different code categories
   - Organize files by functionality and responsibility

4. **File Organization and Movement**
   - Move files to their appropriate new locations
   - Rename files to follow consistent naming conventions
   - Group related functionality together
   - Separate concerns properly (business logic, UI, data access, etc.)

## CLEANUP PHASE
5. **Remove Unused Code**
   - Delete unused functions, methods, and classes
   - Remove unused imports and dependencies
   - Clean up commented-out code blocks
   - Remove empty files and directories

6. **Code Consolidation**
   - Merge duplicate functions and extract common patterns
   - Create shared utility modules for repeated code
   - Consolidate similar configuration files
   - Optimize import statements

Provide detailed documentation of all changes made.
