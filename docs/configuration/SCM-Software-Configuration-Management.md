## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This Software Configuration Management (SCM) plan establishes the procedures, tools, and responsibilities for managing all configuration items throughout the Python-SLAM system lifecycle. The plan ensures controlled development, systematic change management, and complete traceability of all software artifacts.

### 1.2 Scope

**Configuration Items Under Management**:

- Source code (Python, C++, CUDA, shader code)
- Documentation (requirements, design, test plans, user guides)
- Build scripts and configuration files
- Test suites and test data
- Release packages and installation scripts
- Third-party dependencies and licenses

### 1.3 Configuration Management Objectives

| Objective | Success Criteria | Measurement |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------|
| Version Control | 100% of artifacts under version control | Git repository completeness |
| Change Traceability | All changes linked to requirements/issues | Git commit traceability |
| Release Management | Reproducible builds and deployments | Release automation success |
| Branch Management | Clear branching strategy implementation | Branch policy compliance |
| Backup and Recovery | Zero data loss, <1 hour recovery time | Backup validation tests |

## 3. Configuration Item Identification

### 3.1 Configuration Item Categories

#### 3.1.1 Source Code Configuration Items

| Category | File Types | Naming Convention | Version Control |
|----------|------------|------------------|----------------|
| Core SLAM Code | `*.py` in `src/python_slam/` | Module-based hierarchy | Git with tags |
| GPU Kernels | `*.cu`, `*.cl`, `*.metal` | Platform-specific directories | Git with LFS |
| Build Scripts | `setup.py`, `CMakeLists.txt` | Root and module level | Git standard |
| Configuration | `*.json`, `*.yaml`, `*.toml` | Environment-specific naming | Git with validation |

#### 3.1.2 Documentation Configuration Items

| Document Type | Location | Naming Convention | Review Cycle |
|---------------|----------|------------------|--------------|
| Requirements | `docs/requirements/` | `REQ-{TYPE}-{NUMBER}.md` | Major changes only |
| Design Documents | `docs/design/` | `{TYPE}-{COMPONENT}-{VERSION}.md` | Architecture changes |
| Test Documentation | `docs/testing/` | `{TEST-TYPE}-{VERSION}.md` | Release cycles |
| User Documentation | `docs/user/` | `{COMPONENT}-guide.md` | Minor releases |

#### 3.1.3 Release Configuration Items

| Artifact Type | Content | Storage Location | Retention Policy |
|---------------|---------|------------------|------------------|
| Source Releases | Tagged source code | GitHub Releases | Permanent |
| Binary Packages | Compiled packages | PyPI, GitHub | 2 years for dev versions |
| Container Images | Docker containers | Container Registry | 1 year for non-LTS |
| Documentation | Generated docs | GitHub Pages | Permanent for releases |

### 3.2 Configuration Item Labeling

#### 3.2.1 Version Numbering Scheme

**Semantic Versioning (SemVer) Format**: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH[-PRERELEASE][+BUILD]`

**Version Components**:

- **MAJOR**: Incompatible API changes, architectural modifications
- **MINOR**: Backward-compatible functionality additions
- **PATCH**: Backward-compatible bug fixes
- **PRERELEASE**: Alpha, beta, rc (release candidate) identifiers
- **BUILD**: Build metadata (commit hash, build date)

**Examples**:

- `1.0.0` - First major release
- `1.1.0` - Minor feature addition
- `1.1.1` - Bug fix release
- `2.0.0-beta.1` - Second major version beta
- `1.2.0+20251002.abc123` - Release with build metadata

#### 3.2.2 Git Tagging Strategy

**Tag Types**:

- **Release Tags**: `v{MAJOR}.{MINOR}.{PATCH}` (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
- **Pre-release Tags**: `v{MAJOR}.{MINOR}.{PATCH}-{PRERELEASE}` (e.g., `v1.1.0-beta.1`)
- **Milestone Tags**: `milestone-{NAME}` (e.g., `milestone-performance-baseline`)

**Tag Creation Process**:

1. Complete testing and validation
2. Update version numbers in all relevant files
3. Create annotated tag with release notes
4. Push tag to trigger automated release process

### 4.2 Branching Strategy

#### 4.2.1 Git Flow Implementation

```mermaid
gitgraph
    commit id: "Initial"
    branch develop
    checkout develop
    commit id: "Dev Setup"

    branch feature/gpu-acceleration
    checkout feature/gpu-acceleration
    commit id: "GPU Detection"
    commit id: "CUDA Support"

    checkout develop
    merge feature/gpu-acceleration

    branch release/1.0.0
    checkout release/1.0.0
    commit id: "Release Prep"
    commit id: "Bug Fixes"

    checkout main
    merge release/1.0.0
    commit id: "v1.0.0" tag: "v1.0.0"

    checkout develop
    merge release/1.0.0
```

#### 4.2.2 Branch Types and Policies

**Main Branch (`main`)**:

- **Purpose**: Production-ready code only
- **Protection**: Requires PR approval, passing CI/CD
- **Merge Policy**: Squash and merge from release branches
- **Direct Commits**: Prohibited (emergency hotfixes only)

**Development Branch (`develop`)**:

- **Purpose**: Integration of completed features
- **Protection**: Requires PR approval, passing tests
- **Merge Policy**: Merge commits to preserve feature history
- **Quality Gate**: All tests pass, code review completed

**Feature Branches (`feature/{feature-name}`)**:

- **Purpose**: Individual feature development
- **Lifetime**: Creation to feature completion
- **Merge Target**: `develop` branch
- **Naming**: Descriptive, kebab-case (e.g., `feature/ros2-integration`)

**Release Branches (`release/{version}`)**:

- **Purpose**: Release preparation and stabilization
- **Created From**: `develop` branch when feature-complete
- **Merge Target**: Both `main` and `develop`
- **Changes Allowed**: Bug fixes, documentation updates only

**Hotfix Branches (`hotfix/{issue}`)**:

- **Purpose**: Critical production bug fixes
- **Created From**: `main` branch
- **Merge Target**: Both `main` and `develop`
- **Lifecycle**: Immediate (hours to days)

### 4.3 Commit Standards

#### 4.3.1 Commit Message Format

**Conventional Commits Standard**:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Commit Types**:

- **feat**: New feature implementation
- **fix**: Bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation changes
- **style**: Code style changes (formatting, no logic changes)
- **refactor**: Code refactoring without feature/bug changes
- **test**: Test additions or modifications
- **chore**: Build process, auxiliary tool changes

**Examples**:

```
feat(gpu): add CUDA acceleration for feature extraction

Implement CUDA kernels for parallel feature detection and description.
Achieves 3.5x speedup on RTX 4070 compared to CPU implementation.

Closes #123
```

```
fix(slam): resolve tracking loss in low-light conditions

Improve feature detection threshold adaptation and add predictive
tracking when feature count drops below minimum threshold.

Fixes #456
```

#### 4.3.2 Code Review Requirements

**Review Criteria**:

- Code follows established style guidelines
- Adequate test coverage for new functionality
- Documentation updated for public APIs
- Performance impact assessed for critical paths
- Security implications reviewed

**Review Process**:

1. Developer creates pull request with description and tests
2. Automated CI/CD pipeline executes (build, test, analysis)
3. Peer review by at least one other developer
4. Lead developer approval for architectural changes
5. Merge to target branch after all approvals

4. **Validation and Communication** (8-24 hours):
   - Complete data integrity verification
   - Resume normal development operations
   - Conduct post-incident review and improvements

#### 7.2.2 Build System Recovery

**CI/CD Pipeline Failure**:

1. **Detection and Assessment**:
   - Automated monitoring alerts
   - Impact assessment (affected branches/PRs)
   - Fallback to manual build processes if needed

2. **Recovery Actions**:
   - Restore pipeline configurations from version control
   - Re-run failed builds after issue resolution
   - Validate restored functionality

**Artifact Recovery**:

1. **Package Repository Issues**:
   - Re-build and re-publish packages from source
   - Verify package integrity and signatures
