### Project Analysis
This project is a Python-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) framework. It aims to provide modular, extensible tools for robotics and computer vision applications, focusing on real-time mapping and localization. The initial version will implement a basic SLAM pipeline, with plans to support multiple algorithms and sensor types in future phases.

## ðŸ§­ What is Python SLAM?
Python SLAM refers to using Python to implement **Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)**â€”a technique that enables robots or devices to build a map of an unknown environment while tracking their own position within it.

### What SLAM Does
SLAM solves two problems at once:
- **Localization**: Where am I?
- **Mapping**: What does the environment look like?

Itâ€™s used in robotics, autonomous vehicles, drones, AR/VR, and more.

### Python SLAM Libraries & Tools
| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **pySLAM** | A full-featured Python framework for Visual SLAM using monocular, stereo, or RGB-D cameras. Includes feature tracking, loop closure, depth prediction, and semantic mapping. |
| **BreezySLAM** | Lightweight Python wrapper around C-based SLAM algorithms. Great for educational use and quick prototyping. |
| **graphslam** | Python package for graph-based SLAM optimization. Supports pose graph optimization and landmark association. |
| **OpenCV + NumPy** | Often used to build custom SLAM pipelines from scratch, especially for visual SLAM. |

### SLAM in Python: What You Can Build
- **Visual SLAM**: Uses camera input to track motion and reconstruct the environment.
- **Graph SLAM**: Uses pose graphs and optimization to refine trajectory and map.
- **Monocular SLAM**: SLAM with a single cameraâ€”cheaper but scale is ambiguous.
- **RGB-D SLAM**: Uses depth sensors for more accurate 3D mapping.

### Example Use Case
Imagine a drone flying indoors with no GPS. A Python SLAM system can:
- Track its position using onboard cameras
- Build a 3D map of the room
- Avoid obstacles and navigate autonomously
