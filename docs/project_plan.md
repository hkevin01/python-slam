### Project Analysis
This project is a Python-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) framework. It aims to provide modular, extensible tools for robotics and computer vision applications, focusing on real-time mapping and localization. The initial version will implement a basic SLAM pipeline, with plans to support multiple algorithms and sensor types in future phases.
